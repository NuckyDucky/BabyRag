# BabyRag

## Introduction
Welcome to BabyRag, a submission for the AMD Hackster.io Pervasive AI Contest 2023. This project is designed to create a coherent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) style infrastructure, inspired by the ambitions of superboogav2. Using cutting-edge AI and AMDâ€™s powerful processing capabilities, BabyRag aims to enhance text processing applications with advanced text embedding and retrieval techniques.

## Features
- **Text Embedding and Retrieval**: Utilizes BERT models for generating and retrieving text embeddings.
- **Enhanced Interaction**: Implements a Flask-based web interface for dynamic interaction with the AI.
- **Real-time Processing**: Leverages the computing power of AMD hardware for efficient data handling and processing.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
### Hardware:
- AMD Ryzen processors (recommended for optimal performance)
### Software:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch, Transformers, Flask
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repository/BabyRag.git`
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure your AMD hardware as per the guidelines provided in the `hardware_setup.md` document.

## Usage
To start the server and upload your files, very similarly to how you would do with superbooga/''V2. You don't need to fetch your data, but if you do it generates a cool json with your embeddings. Oobabooga's Web-UI has custom chat generation
only work for 'chat' mode, but I plan to expand this as I become more familiar with the infrastructure.
